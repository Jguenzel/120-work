final project proposal

my plan for my final project is making a sprite dancing and or moving underneath a moon while a loop of dancing underneath the moonlight is playing in the background. The user will also be able to interact with this sketch by being able to draw star particles when pressing down the left mouse button. 
for the up coming project i will have to learn the following in p5.js:
* how to create particle effects in p5.js
* how to load animation into p5.js
* how to add sound to a p5.js sketch

what inspired me for this project was some of the old nintendo games and role playing games I used to play as a kid. The most influentual of these games being pokemon diamond for the nintendo ds, with its day and night cycle as well as nostalgic music and minigames you could play. my favorite time to play was at night in the game mostly because of the cooler tones and atmosphere of the game.my goal for this project is to recreate that same feeling but with different music and have it set at night. the sprites in this game are also another reason of why I want to make this look like a pixelated nintendo game rather than a crisp flash game or mobile app. I also love pixelated games as they remind me of long car trips at night listening to my dad's music, and playing my ds or gameboy. the art style gives a great rush of nostalgia.
