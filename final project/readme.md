# Empty p5 sketch.

# the final product
 1.my final is a sketch of a small 8 bit stick figure dancing underneath a moon to dancing in the moonlight and is a piece of art you can interact with by clicking on the background to randomly generate stars. originally I was going to make a function that would allow you to draw the stars and they would spread out randomly, I had to make some changes as the local server I made as well as my browser would not show the function or what it was doing. eventually I changed the function to randomly generate stars on the canvas randomly and the function started to work properly and even showed above the background image. sound was another issue I had with this product and took up most of my time figuring out how to get the sound to load or respond. the other problem I encountered was with loading the stick figure as a sprite, I eventually compiled the sprite into a gif for easier formatting and functionality. finally I had solved most of my issues and the sketch works like intended with the viewer being able to randomly generate stars while a stick figure and dancing in the monlight plays in the background.

2.this week I also spent a lot of time researching, creating assets, as well as solving minor or major problems with the sketch. The most time spent on this project was with creating the background as well as setting up a localhost server so my project could function properly without anyone encountering errors or loading issues. At times I would spend around four hours searching resolutions to my problems, the biggest problem being the mousepressed function not drawing above the background which was solved with a simple if statement and  changing the image to load in the function setup rather than function draw.

3. what I learned from this project was how to properly compile images as well as how to setup a local serverhost for my code. I also learned how to properly preload images and gifs as well as sound and how to play sound files as well.

4.  this project was tough but was a lot of fun to make as well as code and it is a project that I can say perfectly captures what I had imagined for it.
