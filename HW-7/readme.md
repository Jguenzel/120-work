# HW 7 | Describe then Alter the Bouncing Ball

## Description of What the Original Code is Doing


1.the original code is making a ball bounce up and down from the left side of the canvas to the right side of the canvas. the code uses the if function to make to make it so when the ball is clicked it moves at a faster pace and moves around the canvas bouncing of each of the edges clicking the ball also makes it change direction.

the first line of the code is a javascript object which contains the values of which the ball will work from. the twelfth line of code is the function setup that creates our canvas and background as well as the space the ball will bounce around in this continues to the 14th line. the ninteenth line starts with the function draw which creates the visual aspect of the circle with the conditional statements statiing if ballx is greater the the width than ball x is lesser than 0 and ball x is equal to -1 multiplied by ball.delta the same then continues with ball y and this sets the height and width of our bouncing ball. the color of our ball is set to white with our fill command and the ellipse is set up with the statements we defined on previous lines.
on the 36th line we have the final function "mousePressed" the function that gives the ability to change the direction of the ball when the mouse is pressed down.

2.you can make the ball change direction by clicking the ball which will make it change direction and bounce off the edges of the canvas as well as changing its speed.

## How did you alter the sketch?
I changed the sketch to change color of the ball to make it a random color as it moves around the canvas. I also changed the color of the background to green so it would add to the random color command of the bouncing ball. the reason of why I changed the bouncing ball is  so the ball would look more appealing as well as more toned down in color rather than have a white ball bounding around a pure white background.
