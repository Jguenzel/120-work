Home work Week 6

1. for this week I made algorithmic art in p.5 and made an orange circle stroke that would stroke randomly as it went across the canvas as well as a green blob object that I called alien that would also move around the canvas randomly from its starting position.

2.The steps I took to complete this weeks assignment was for one making sure that each piece of code was functional and making sure that each piece of code did hat I wanted it to.

3. I had a lot of issues this week, none of which were problems with my code but more so with my computer and the browser I was using.

4. there was nothing in particular that I learned that I would like to discuss further.

5.I did not help any of my fellow students with any problems this week.
