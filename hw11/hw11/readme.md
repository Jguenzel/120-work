1. this week I learned how to use OOP and made a sketch that created vibrating blocks that look like fireflies.

2.I had a few problems with my code especially with when I forgot to add the display command, but I eventually fixed it by looking over my code and each line for mistakes.

3.the steps I took to complete this assignment was learning each new command as well as testing out each command making sure that it is functional.

4.I learned nothing in particular this week that I have learned that I could add on to or share with the class.

5. I did not help my classmates with any problems this week.
