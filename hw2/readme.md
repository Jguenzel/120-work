============'''

what I did this week was how to create a testfile with our names and date using our text editor and learn the basics of github and atom.
The steps I took to complete the assignment was to read the instructions carefully, re-read the instructions if I had a problem and look at the issue forum for solutions.
I had no problems or issue and I did not use the issue repo tracker.
one of the things that I learned that I would love to discuss is how we learned to create a new file in through code which is defnitley useful with certain assignments.
I did not help anyone in the issue repo tracker or help any solve problems
