1.what I did this week was learn how to create a testfile1 with our names and date using our text editor and learn the basics of github and atom. what I also did was learn to make some commands to make headers and paragraphs in atom as well as the basics of atom.

2.The steps I took to complete the assignment was to read the instructions carefully, re-read the instructions if I had a problem and look at the issue forum for solutions.

3.I had no problems or issue and I did not use the issue repo tracker. I tried my best to solve things on my own and carefully read the instructions.

4.one of the things that I learned that I would love to discuss is how we learned to create a new file in through code which is definitley useful with certain assignments.

5.I did not help anyone in the issue repo tracker or help any solve problems
