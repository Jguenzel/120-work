# Empty p5 sketch.
1. what I learned this week was how to make objects interact with each other as well as recognize that interaction. originally I had made a sketch with skulls that would change the background whenever they interacted. however for this weeks assignment I had changed the design and started from the beginning due to technical problems with my computer. this week I designed red blood cells that flash with a black and white pattern when they get close together.

2. this week I had problems with getting my cells to change the background color but fixed it by heavily looking over my if statement and fixing a spelling error that caused the blocks to freeze rather than change the background's color to the white and black random color function.

3. I had no other issues this week other personal technical difficulties which prevented me from doing this assignment.

4.I didn't learn anything particular this week that I could discuss further other than the fact that I noticed the blood cells sometimes showed up in front of the background rather than behind it.

5. I did not help any of my classmates on the issues forum.
