homework week 8
3/10/2019
1. this week I learned how to make loops in p5.js with the commands for and while and made an abstract piece of generative art that draws circles from the top of the screen to the bottom of the screen.

2. what I did to complete this weeks project was making sure that the browser didn't slow down or crash when operating the code. This was because certain commands I used or executed would slow down the browser and ruin the experience of the generative art. So I tested each piece of code until I came to a result I was happy with.

3.the issues I had this week were certain functions slowing down my browser or functions not working at all.

4.though there was a lot I learned this week there is nothing in particular I could discuss further.

5. I did not help any of my fellow students with their problems this week.
