homework week 10
3/21/2019


1. this week I learned how to use arrays as well as how to make and define my own functions, with this I made a creepy eye that changes colors with the array I made.

2. this week I tested each part of the code to make sure that it would show up properly and would function correctly and in a way that I wanted to, this took me a little while as I had trouble with the array making the iris of the eye change color wouldn't function correctly and would only stay on color 0, i fixed this by rearranging the code underneath the draweyeguy function.

3. I had no other issues besides the eye not changing color, which was pretty easy to solve.

4. I didn't learn anything this week that I could discuss further for this project.

5. I did not help any of my classmates on the issues forum.
